.SH DESCRIPTION
makedeltarpm creates a deltarpm from two rpms. The deltarpm can
later be used to recreate the new rpm from either filesystem data
or the old rpm. Use the
.B -v
option to make makedeltarpm more verbose about its work (use it
twice to make it even more verbose).
.PP
If you want to create a
smaller and faster to combine "rpm-only" deltarpm which does not
work with filesystem data, specify the
.B -r
option.
.PP
makedeltarpm normally produces
a V3 format deltarpm, use the
.B -V
option to specify a different version if desired. The
.B -z
option can be used to specify a different compression method, the
default is to use the same compression method as used in the
new rpm.
.PP
The
.B -s
option makes makedeltarpm write out the sequence id to the specified
file
.IR seqfile .

If you also use patch rpms you should use the
.B -p
option to specify the rpm-print of
.I oldrpm
and the created
patch rpm. This option tells makedeltarpm to exclude the files that
were not included in the patch rpm but are not byteswise identical
to the ones in oldrpm.
.PP
makedeltarpm can also create an "identity" deltarpm by adding the
.B -u
switch. In this case only one rpm has to be specified. An identity
deltarpm can be useful to just replace the signature header of a
rpm or to reconstruct a rpm from the filesystem.
