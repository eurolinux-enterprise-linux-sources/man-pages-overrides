.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fB@mysysconfdir@/oddjobd.conf.d/oddjobd-mkhomedir.conf\fR is typically
processed along with other files in the \fB@mysysconfdir@/oddjobd.conf.d\fR
directory.

The mkhomedir helper itself accepts these options:
.TP
-q
Refrain from outputting the usual "Creating home directory..." message when it
creates a home directory.
.TP
-n
Only create the home directory; do not populate it using the contents of the
skeleton directory.
.TP
-s
Override the location of the skeleton directory (by default: \fI/etc/skel\fR).
.TP
-u
Specify a umask whose bits are masked off of contents of the skeleton directory
while they are copied to the user's new home directory.  The default is read
from \fB/etc/login.defs\fR.
