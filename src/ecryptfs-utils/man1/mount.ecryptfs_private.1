.SH NAME
mount.ecryptfs_private \- eCryptfs private mount helper.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmount.ecryptfs_private\fP

\fBNOTE:\fP This program will \fBnot\fP dynamically load the relevant keys.  For this reason, it is recommended that users use \fBecryptfs-mount-private\fP(1) instead!

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmount.ecryptfs_private\fP is a mount helper utility for non-root users, who are members of \fBecryptfs\fP group, to cryptographically mount a private directory, ~/Private.

If, and only if:
  - the private mount passphrase is in their kernel keyring, and
  - the current user owns both ~/.Private and ~/Private, and
  - ~/Private is not already mounted, then

This program will:
  - mount ~/.Private onto ~/Private
  - as an ecryptfs filesystem
  - using the AES cipher
  - with a key length of 16 bytes
  - using the passphrase whose signature is in ~/.ecryptfs/Private.sig

The only setuid operation in this program is the call to \fBmount\fP(8).

The \fBecryptfs-setup-private\fP(1) utility will create the ~/.Private and ~/Private directories, generate a mount passphrase, wrap the passphrase, and write the ~/.ecryptfs/Private.sig.

The system administrator can add the pam_ecryptfs.so module to the PAM stack which will automatically use the login passphrase to unwrap the mount passphrase, add the passphrase to the user's kernel keyring, and automatically perform the mount. See \fBpam_ecryptfs\fP(8).

.SH FILES
\fI~/.Private\fP - underlying directory containing encrypted data

\fI~/Private\fP - mountpoint containing decrypted data (when mounted)

\fI~/.ecryptfs/Private.sig\fP - file containing signature of mountpoint passphrase

\fI~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\fP - mount passphrase, encrypted with the login passphrase
