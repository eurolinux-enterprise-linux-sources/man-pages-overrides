 .SH DESCRIPTION
 GNU `tar' saves many files together into a single tape or disk archive, and can
 restore individual files from the archive.
+
+Note that this manual page contains just very brief description (or more like
+a list of possible functionality) originally generated by the
+.B
+help2man
+utility.  The full documentation for
+.B tar
+is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the
+.B info
+and
+.B tar
+programs are properly installed at your site, the command
+.B `info tar'
+should give you access to the complete manual.
