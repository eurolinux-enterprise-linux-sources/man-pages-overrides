+This daemon reads /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/setrans.conf and /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/secolor.conf configuration files, and communicates with libselinux via a socket in /var/run/setrans.
 It also watches for files created in /var/run/setrans and uses the contents of these files to generate translations to the names.  For example writing a file /var/run/setrans/mydomain with content of s0:c1,c2 will cause mcstrans to translate s0:c1,c2 to mydomain.
