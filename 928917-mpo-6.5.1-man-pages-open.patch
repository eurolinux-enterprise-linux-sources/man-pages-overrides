 Under Linux 2.6, alignment to 512-byte boundaries

+.B O_DIRECT
+I/Os should never be run concurrently with the
+.BR fork (2)
+system call,
+if the memory buffer is a private mapping
+(i.e., any mapping created with the
+.BR mmap (2)
+.BR MAP_PRIVATE
+flag;
+this includes memory allocated on the heap and statically allocated buffers).
+Any such I/Os, whether submitted via an asynchronous I/O interface or from
+another thread in the process,
+should be completed before
+.BR fork (2)
+is called.
+Failure to do so can result in data corruption and undefined behavior in
+parent and child processes.
+This restriction does not apply when the memory buffer for the
+.B O_DIRECT
+I/Os was created using
+.BR shmat (2)
+or
+.BR mmap (2)
+with the
+.B MAP_SHARED
+flag.
+Nor does this restriction apply when the memory buffer has been advised as
+.B MADV_DONTFORK
+with
+.BR madvise (2),
+ensuring that it will not be available

+.BR fork (2).

 The
 .B O_DIRECT
 flag was introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has alignment
